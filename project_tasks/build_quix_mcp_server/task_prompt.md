I would like to build an MCP server using the MCP Python SDK. This server should use Python to interact with the Quix Platform APi. 

If you don’t know what the MCP Python SDK is, or what the Model Context Protocol is (MCP) go ask Perplexity.

Some context on the Quix Platform: Quix is a serverless CaaS platform that is tightly coupled with Apache Kafka (a toy version of Kafka also runs within the Quix cloud platform.). In Quix, all containers come with the Quix Streams Python library pre-installed. This is because containers are supposed to communicate with each other via Kafka topics rather than other transport methods such as REST APIs. Quix Streams is both a python producer/consumer (using confluent-kakfa) and a stream processing library (loosely akin to Faust). Users can build stream processing applications and deploy them all within the Quix Platform.

I have included some reference MCP servers that other people have built.

`examples/weather.py` \- a simple MCP server that uses the SSE protocol to interact with MCP clients. It pings a weather API to get information about certain location  
`examples/sentry_server.py` \- a simple MCP server that works with issues using the sentry API  
`examples/git_server.py` \- a simple MCP server that uses the git python library to trigger various Git operations

I have also included some extra reference material for you to read.

`reference/MCP_PYTHON_SDK_README.md` — will help you understand the Python MCP SDK generally.

Now for the Quix specific information.

You can find the reference documentation about Quix Portal API operations that I want to use in the `swagger` folder. There is a separate Swagger file for each group of operations that I want this MCP server to support.

There are a lot of operations available, so focus on the operations in the “Deployment” and “Library” sections. 

# NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY

*  “Deployment” is simply a Container that has been built and has been “deployed” in Quix (which is based on K8s so uses similar concepts to kubernetes under the hood)  
* The “library” contains “library items” ; these are just a selection of definitions of containerized applications including code and config (similar to Dockerhub or a private container registry). The Quix team created these library items to help users get started.

You should also read the following MD file which shows you how to construct a request.   
`reference/quix-http-requests.md`

As you will understand after reading,  the MCP server needs to accept two environment variables.

* The bearer token (aka PAT token)  
* The base URL such as “[`https://portal-myenv.platform.quix.io`](https://portal-myenv.platform.quix.io)`/”`  
  (we are only using the portal API so users can hardcode the API section of the URL.)

# NOTE ON APPLICATION OPERATIONS

  Here is another thing that the MCP needs to know for 'Application' related operations. The endpoint to "Update an existing application" is a PATCH operation, meaning that any array in the payload will be overwritten. Since the "variables" parameter is an array of items, any update the the variables will be overwritten. For examples, if I want add one variable called "foo", the existing array of variables (e.g. "input-topic","output-topic", ect..) will be overwritten by the new array. Therefore, if a user wants to add a new variable, the MCP server needs to know it should first get the details of the application (from the endpoint to "Get a single application") inspect the details of the existing environment variables, and make sure they are included in the array that updates the application with a new environment variable. Is that clear?

# NOTE ON FILE STRUCTURE

This  MCP server should be modularized so that there is one server that imports all of the individual "tools" that it needs. Please design the MCP server so that to imports everything it needs from external files and so I only need to run the server as a single unit:

To give you an idea of what I want, have a look at the following directory stucture for another MCP server. It's an MCP server for the project management tool "Shortcut" (an alternative to JIRA). It supports most of the operations in the Shortcut REST API, but they are modularized as separate "tool" files. Although it is Typescript and not Python, this should give you an idea of the kind of modularity that I want.

Lastly, MCP clients (such as MCP inspector) should be able to connect to the QUIX MCP server using the SSE protocol.
